## Git Process

**To keep the version control neat I'm just going to write a basic process of how you should be dealing with git**

* Whenever you start making changes to the code base try and remember to use "git pull", this will pull all the latest changes on that branch and save you from any pontential conflicts when you push
* When you adding new code, create a new branch and call it something sensible, related to the change/feature, unless the feature is significantly small, a new branch is not necessary
* When your are happy with your new code, commit your changes and give it a sensible name and description e.g "Landing page - Added a logo to the landing page"
* Make sure you push your code so the new branch is added to the remote repository
* We'll then discuss these changes and merge them with the branch, typically during stand up
